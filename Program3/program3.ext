Error Handling Documentation:
Lexical error - Unrecognized characters: 
  For unrecognized characters, it will print out an error message that it came across
  an unrecognized character and then skip the character and continue checking.
  
Syntax error:
  If Bison can't match something before a semicolon, it will create an error
  for that entire line, indicating where it first started failing to match.
